            <p>Nien Cheng or Zheng Nian (January 28, 1915 – November 2, 2009) is the pen name of Yao Nien-Yuan (Chinese:
                姚念媛; pinyin: Yáo Niànyuán). She was a Chinese author who recounted her experiences during the Cultural
                Revolution in her memoir Life and Death in Shanghai.</p>

            <p>Cheng was born into a rich landowning family in Beijing. She studied at Yenching University and later
                went to London to obtain a master's degree at the London School of Economics. She returned to China
                after graduation.</p>
            <p>During her time in London, Cheng also met her husband Kang-chi Cheng and converted to Christianity. Upon
                their return to China, Kang-chi Cheng joined the Foreign Affairs ministry of the Nationalist government.
                The couple lived in Australia briefly, setting up an embassy there,and eventually moved to Shanghai.
                After the Communist Party of China came to power in 1949, Kang-chi Cheng served at Shell's office in
                Shanghai until his death from cancer in 1957. Nien Cheng then joined the company as an adviser.The
                couple had one daughter named Meiping, but she died under uncertain circumstances when her mother was in
                prison.</p>

            <p>In 1966, Cheng was targeted by Red Guards and accused of being a British spy, as she was both
                Western-educated and the widow of the former manager of a foreign firm in Shanghai.</p>
            <p>Cheng's book documents her account of her subsequent confinement, which lasted for more than six years.
                According to her book, Cheng managed to endure the tortures and abuses inflicted by the interrogators
                and never made any false confessions or perjuries. Cheng used Chinese Communist Party founder Chairman
                Mao Zedong's teachings successfully against her interrogators, frequently turning the tide of the
                struggle sessions against them. Although the living conditions at the detention house were inhumanly
                squalid, Cheng still tried to maintain her dignity and keep her appearance decent as much as possible.
                In 1973, when offered parole on the basis that her attitude had shown improvement, Cheng resisted
                leaving the detention house without first receiving official acknowledgment from her captors that she
                had been unjustly detained.</p>
            <p>Upon her release, Cheng was relocated from her spacious home to two bedrooms on the second floor of a
                two-story building. Cheng continued her life under constant surveillance, including spying by the family
                on the first floor. When released from jail, Cheng was told that her daughter Meiping Cheng (Chinese:
                郑梅萍; pinyin: Zhèng Méipíng) had committed suicide. After Cheng conducted a discreet investigation, she
                found that this scenario was impossible, and she came to believe that Meiping had been murdered by
                Maoists after she refused to denounce her mother. The alleged killer of Meiping, a rebel worker named Hu
                Yongnian, was arrested and given a suspended death sentence by Shanghai authorities in 1980, but he was
                eventually paroled in 1995.</p>
            <p>Cheng lived in China until 1980. Using funds that her husband had placed in overseas bank accounts, she
                first emigrated to Canada and later to Washington, D.C., where she wrote the autobiography. Cheng never
                returned to China. </p>

            <p>Cheng died of renal failure in Washington, D.C., on November 2, 2009.</p>
