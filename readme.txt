Going beyond the parts of HTML and CSS described in the lectures and practical classes to explore features of HTML and CSS that make a website responsive.

▪On the reviews.html, I explored the use of forms in order to collect data from users.
▪On the top of every page, I explored flex on the navigation bar to create a responsive web effect.
▪On the right side of every page, I explored the use of animation with css to make a circle rotate when the mouse hovers.
▪On the background.html, I explored fileter in css to make colored images black and white and make pictures blur.
